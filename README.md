# Time Wizard
When a wizard tries to cast a very special spell, he is horrified to find that someone has taken parts from his pipe organ, which he needs to complete the spell! If he doesn't complete the spell in time, he will LITERALLY EXPLODE! Luckily he has another spell to stop time, but only while he's not moving... can he gather the organ parts and complete the spell before he explodes?
